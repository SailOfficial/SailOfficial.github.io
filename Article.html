                        <p>On October 9, 2018, the Constitutional Convention convened in one of the classrooms of Foothill Technology High School. &nbsp;These delegates came from all over the country to discuss one problem, the Articles of Confederation.
                            The delegates in question were only the smartest and the most brilliant from the surrounding country. &nbsp;They would be the ones to shape the future over the next hour and a half. <br></p>
                        <p>But the delegates weren’t able to concur on a singular course of action. &nbsp;As a result, five factions formed almost instantly which deeply divided the delegates. &nbsp;There was the Virginia Plan (proposed by none other than
                            Edmund Randolph and James Madison, both of whom are from Virginia), the New Jersey Plan (proposed by William Patterson from Virginia as well as input from an emissary from Patrick Henry), the Great Compromise (proposed by Benjamin
                            Franklin of Pennsylvania and Roger Sherman of Connecticut), the Crispus Attucks Coalition (proposed by George Mason of Virginia and Gouverneur Morris of Pennsylvania), and last, the Dixiecrat Bloc (proposed by Charles C. Pinckney
                            of South Carolina and Roger Sherman of Connecticut).<br></p>
                        <p>As the Virginia Plan was the first plan to be fully developed (and this publication is biased towards the Virginia Plan) this writer will explain the Virginia Plan before continuing on with the rest of the convention. &nbsp;The
                            Virginia Plan was put forth to strengthen the federal government so as to insure the safety and security of the people. The idea was to create three separate federal branches of government (legislative, executive, and judiciary)
                            to each have a specific duty (making laws, vetoing/passing laws, and upholding the rule of law respectively) that would mostly balance out the power of the other two. &nbsp;However, the legislative branch was the most powerful
                            out of the three as they chose the people to serve in the executive and judiciary branch. These three branches would also have the ability to override state legislation, so much so that according to Edmund Randolph (the real
                            person, not the student portraying him), “the idea of states should be nearly annihilated”. The federal government wasn’t just in charge of making laws though. &nbsp;It was also in charge of taxation and the use of tariffs,
                            using the armed forces to implement laws, and generally making sure that the government wasn’t just a background figure that couldn’t save the states if a catastrophe were to occur (such as the overwhelming failure during the
                            winter of 1777). <br></p>
                        <p>Overview aside, the convention began. &nbsp;Somehow the delegates has received prior warning as to the split that would occur and each coalition had created a website to show off their main points as well as a radio and a video
                            ad. &nbsp;The Virginia Plan’s radio ad was unfortunately not working as the file wasn’t able to be found on Soundcloud for some reason. However, they seemed confident in their abilities to get it fixed and working as soon as
                            possible. &nbsp;The Virginia Plan also boasted a stellar commercial with James Madison listing a bunch of reasons about why the Virginia Plan was the correct plan to vote for. To top it off, the commercial was expertly edited.
                            <br></p>
                        <p>However, the other delegates reactions to the commercial were mixed. &nbsp;As the delegates seemed to have anticipated the aforementioned split, the classroom was rather quiet as the commercial was played, but from time to time
                            the silence was punctured by peals of laughter such as when the narration deepened and said “Major fiscal damage” while showing an almost empty wallet. &nbsp;<br></p>
                        <p>All of the other websites and ads fell rather flat with none of them coming up to the excellence that was the Virginia Plan’s. &nbsp;They were all satisfactory but there was anticipation building as the websites and ads neared
                            their end. After all, the delegates were here to implore others to vote for their plans, not marvel at some well made website or ad (although the writer must respectfully disagree here and once more state how well the Virginia
                            Plan’s website and ad were. &nbsp;They were truly worthy of marveling at). <br></p>
                        <p>But with the websites and ads finished, the convention moved onto the speeches. &nbsp;Each of the blocs elected a delegate to stand up and deliver a speech about the plan and why the other delegates needed to vote for the plan
                            in question.<br></p>
                        <p>First up was the Dixiecrat delegate. &nbsp;He spoke very confidently with rhetoric peppered throughout his speech. &nbsp;A lot of his speech was simply affirming the need to keep slaves be it the rest of the states needed a “moral
                            punching bag” to make themselves feel better or that “economic machines” would run “on the back of slaves”. &nbsp;However, the real highlight was the end of the speech when the delegate threatened that the Southern states would
                            leave the Union if their demands on the legality of slavery weren’t met due to slavery playing such a key role in their daily lives.<br></p>
                        <p>Next up was the Virginia Plan delegate (James Madison). &nbsp;He delivered a speech that was by far the best. He was the only one to at least attempt to talk with an accent. &nbsp;Which accent is impossible to say as it switched
                            throughout the speech, but he at least gets props for trying. He was also able to overcome the hostility that he faced with well timed jokes throughout, such as asking if “anyone actually pay[s] … if taxes are voluntary”. &nbsp;Additionally,
                            his points were met with smiles and nods throughout the classroom, a feat that was unduplicated in any of the other speeches. After his speech, compliments could be heard praising how well the speech was written and his jokes
                            interspersed throughout.<br></p>
                        <p>The New Jersey Plan came next with a speech advocating for a “stronger constitution” that kept “equal representation by states”. &nbsp;The delegate argued for a “daring new government” that would allow the states to “better protect
                            their own”. However, the speech was summed up with a desire for “no large concentrated power” immediately putting them at odds with the Virginia Plan’s desire for a stronger federal government. &nbsp;<br></p>
                        <p>After the New Jersey Plan came the Crispus Attucks Coalition with their speech about the history of America and how slavery is a “violation of American principles”. &nbsp;They warned about a “retribution from God” if slaves were
                            continued to be “treated as livestock” instead of people. The speech was written very well, but lacked the jovial attitude that the Virginia Plan had and as a result, failed to penetrate the hostility of the audience. &nbsp;<br></p>
                        <p>Last was the Great Compromise with their delegate’s speech about compromise and coming together despite our differences. &nbsp;The delegate advocated for “a place for [all sides]” in the convention and whatever comes out of it.
                            They also expressed optimism with stating the “new nation will flourish” as long as the “opposing sides [are] able to be equally [represented]”. &nbsp;Continuing with their predictions of the future, they believe that failure
                            would bring “disastrous consequences”. <br></p>
                        <p>And with the Great Compromise done speaking, the stage was finally set for the most anticipated event of the convention: the debate.All five groups received a chance to deliver an opening statement for the debate, with all of the
                            groups echoing similar sentiments as their speech, albeit in a much shorter version. &nbsp;And then the debate started. &nbsp;The Virginia Plan was given a chance to speak first, and they pounced, questioning the New Jersey
                            Plan relentlessly about their stance on states getting equal representation no matter the population. &nbsp;The discussion became quite heated with both sides starting to talk over each other and repeat similar statements,
                            until a Virginia Plan delegate asked the crucial question: “What is your definition of a state?” &nbsp;This left the New Jersey Plan ruminating over the question and putting out a rather lackluster answer about being where
                            a group of people lived, at which the Virginia Plan delegate elaborated and clarified as to a state being arbitrary boundaries where people lived. &nbsp;Additionally, the delegate insulted the small states by declaring that
                            no one wanted to live in them, which set the rest of the delegates laughing. The New Jersey delegates respond by expressing fear at being overwhelmed by the agenda of the large states to which the Virginia Plan delegates ask
                            for an example, of which none was provided, and pointed out that the smaller states could form their own coalitions to push their own agendas through as everyone has an agenda. &nbsp;At this point, the New Jersey Plan seemed
                            to have nothing else to add, and none of the other groups chimed in on the idea of a federal government, so the debate moved to slavery. <br></p>
                        <p>The next unofficial section of the debate focused on slavery in the colonies. &nbsp;The Dixiecrats took a stance of being perfectly happy with slaves counting for 3/5 of a person, and the Crispus Attucks Coalition pushed for slaves
                            to be counted as a full person for the population and proceeded to disagree on whether slaves would count as a full person. &nbsp;Personally, the writer was very confused over this because the writer thought that the Dixiecrats
                            would want the slaves to count as a full person so they could gain more representation and the Crispus Attucks Coalition would want them to not count as they weren’t free and were viewed as property, but then again, the writer
                            didn’t research that topic as one of the delegates, so they probably knew better than the writer did. &nbsp;But getting back on track, the debate started to get heated again at this point with both sides refusing to back down,
                            at which the Great Compromise delegates stepped in and did their job. They initiated the thought of gradual emancipation, and as a result, the slaves gradually being worth more and more of a person until they reached a full
                            person status after 15 to 20 years. At this the two sides agreed that kicking slavery down the road was a good idea, especially since the idea was going to be incrementally solved, both allowing for the Dixiecrats to continue
                            their reliance on a slave drive economy (albeit they would have to gradually stop using slaves) while the Crispus Attucks Coalition were allowed to reach their goal of abolition and slaves counting as a full person. &nbsp;&nbsp;At
                            this point the Virginia Plan chimed in with agreement for this plan due to the white farmers becoming lazy due to a lack of necessary work and agreed that this might lower the social inequities between those who owned a lot
                            of slaves and those who didn’t. <br></p>
                        <p>Wrapping up the debate, each group was allowed to make a closing statement on the debate. &nbsp;The Virginia Plan spoke first and declared that they felt they had done extremely well especially since they felt that they won their
                            debate against the New Jersey Plan as they outmaneuvered them and ran them out of counterarguments. &nbsp;The New Jersey Plan expressed hope that their idea of a government would eventually be used in the future. The Crispus
                            Attucks Coalition and the Dixiecrat Bloc both expressed that they were happy with the compromise on slavery where slaves would eventually be worth a full person and be free. &nbsp;Finally, the Great Compromise felt they had
                            the best plan because at the end everyone had started to agree and uttered prophetic words about unity being a key component in the coming months as without unity, failure is destined to happen. <br></p>
                        <p>Personally, this writer thinks that the Virginia Plan did the best at this convention. &nbsp;The future is very bright for them as they were able to outmaneuver their New Jersey Plan opponents and potentially set themselves up
                            for federal government decisions to be made by representatives determined by the population of a state. &nbsp;Additionally, over the years, their population appears to be able to grow by quite a bit as slaves start to count
                            for more and more of a person, which translates into an increased amount of influence for the big states. However, only time will tell the success of these individual plans and what works and what does not. &nbsp;<br></p>
